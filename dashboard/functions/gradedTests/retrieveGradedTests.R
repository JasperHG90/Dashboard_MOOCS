#' Get a dataframe with all graded quizzes for a course.
#' 
#' Graded quizzes are further split in branches (when you have different versions of the same course) and versions.
#' 
#' @param con Postgresql connection object returned by the \seealso{psql} function.
#' @param from Date from which you want to query (inclusive). Must be passed in YYYY-MM-DD format. 
#' @param to Date to which you want to query (inclusive). Defaults to date of today. Must be passed in YYYY-MM-DD format.

#' @return tibble with 4 columns and n rows for the number of assignments present. Column 1 is the item_id of the quiz, column 2 is the course_item_name, column 3 is the course_branch_id, and column 4 is the assessment_id. Note that an assignment may appear multiple times IF the course is branched (i.e. is running multiple versions of the same course for the purposes of e.g. an A/B test or to split groups).
